I'm successfully able to style the user interface almost the same as we are given.
I have created **next** and **reset** buttons but they are not functioning.
It was a learning experience for me, I had to take the help of various online sources and YT videos.
I thought of adding many other things as well like... 
Mentioning a helpline number for any query. 
Announcement section which involves any change in the curriculum of present departments or if any new department has been introduced in the college.
Because all this is new to me therefore it took a significant amount of time. Nevertheless, I think I did well and I'm also trying to make it better.
